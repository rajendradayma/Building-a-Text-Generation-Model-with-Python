## Features
- Ability to generate creative sentences based on prompts.
- Trained on a comprehensive dataset to ensure diverse outputs.
- Easy-to-use interface for input and output.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NLTK / SpaCy
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)

## Dataset
This project utilizes the [Project Gutenberg dataset](https://www.gutenberg.org/) as the primary source of text data. The dataset includes a wide range of literary works, making it ideal for training a generative text model.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-generation-model.git
   cd text-generation-model
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Run the `TextGenerationModel.ipynb` notebook.
3. Input a prompt in the designated cell and execute the cell to generate text.

## Model Training
The model is implemented using [TensorFlow / PyTorch] and is designed to learn from the dataset through several epochs. Hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size can be adjusted in the notebook to optimize performance.

## Evaluation
Model performance can be evaluated using metrics such as perplexity. Additionally, qualitative assessment of generated sentences can provide insight into the model's creativity and grammaticality.
